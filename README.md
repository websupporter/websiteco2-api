# Website Co2 API

Inspired by websitecarbon.com the aim of 
this API is to try and measure how much Co2
is used by a page load of a website.

## Prerequisite
* Composer (getcomposer.org)
* Node
* npm/yarn
* Chrome browser
* Server which can execute PHP scripts


## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/websupporter/websiteco2-api.git
composer install
npm install
```

## Remarks

Currently I just evaluate this project. If
you find it already useful, great! But this
project is not near to a public release.
